# MSHyper
This repo is the official implementation for Multi-Scale Adaptive Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.

## 1.1 The framework of MSHyper
![framework](https://github.com/shangzongjiang/MSHyper/blob/main/fig/figure1_last7.pdf)
# 2 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8.5
* PyTorch 1.13.1
* math, sklearn, numpy, torch_geometric
* # 3 Datasets
To evaluate the performance of H2former, we conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasetsï¼š [Weather](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/), [ETT](https://github.com/MAZiqing/FEDformer), [Traffic](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/), and [Electricity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014).
## 3.1 Weather
This dataset contains 21 meteorological measurements data form the Weather Station of the Max Planck Biogeochemistry, which are sampled every 10 minutes.
## 3.2 Traffic
This dataset contains the road occupancy rates of 862 sensors in San Francisco Bay Area freeways, which are sampled hourly.
## 3.3 Electricity
This dataset contains the electricity consumption of 321 clients from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which are sampled hourly.
## 3.5 ETT
This dataset contains the oil temperature and load data collected by electricity transformers, including ETTh and ETTm, which are sampled hourly and every 15 minutes respectively
